# FaceGaze
A real-time face detection application using Mediapipe that identifies and marks faces in video feeds.

# Face Detection Using MediaPipe

## Project Overview
This repository contains a real-time face detection application built with Google's MediaPipe framework. The application is designed to accurately detect and annotate faces in video streams, demonstrating the capabilities of MediaPipe for practical computer vision tasks. 

## Features
- **Real-time Detection**: Processes video feeds to detect faces in real-time.
- **Bounding Box Visualization**: Draws precise bounding boxes around detected faces.
- **Efficient Performance**: Optimized for speed and accuracy, suitable for real-world applications.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable for integration with other MediaPipe functionalities.

## Requirements
To execute this project, ensure you have the following software installed:

- **Python**: Version 3.x
- **OpenCV**: For video processing and display
- **MediaPipe**: For face detection functionalities

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
